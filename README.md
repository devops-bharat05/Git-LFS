To integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) into your project and manage large binary files efficiently, follow the steps below. This guide will demonstrate how to add, commit, and push binary files to a repository, ensuring they are tracked by Git LFS correctly. Additionally, it will show how to clone the repository on another machine to verify that the binary files are downloaded correctly.

# Git LFS Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) into your project to handle large binary files efficiently. It covers how to add, commit, and push binary files to the repository and ensure they are tracked correctly by Git LFS. Additionally, it includes steps to clone the repository on another machine to verify the binary files are downloaded correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Git is installed on your machine.
- Install Git LFS:
  - **macOS:** `brew install git-lfs`
  - **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install git-lfs`
  - **Windows:** Git for Windows includes Git LFS

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Initialize Git LFS in Your Repository

1. Install Git LFS:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Track the file types you want to store in Git LFS (e.g., `.bin` files):
   ```sh
   git lfs track "*.bin"
   ```

3. Add the `.gitattributes` file created by Git LFS:
   ```sh
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initialize Git LFS and track .bin files"
   ```

### 2. Add and Commit Large Binary Files

1. Add your large binary files to the repository:
   ```sh
   git add path/to/your/largefile.bin
   ```

2. Commit the binary files:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add large binary file"
   ```

### 3. Push the Changes to the Remote Repository

1. Push the changes, including the large binary files, to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### 4. Clone the Repository on Another Machine

1. On another machine, clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install Git LFS:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

4. Pull the LFS files:
   ```sh
   git lfs pull
   ```

### Verification

1. Verify that the large binary files are downloaded correctly by checking their existence and integrity in the cloned repository.

### Additional Commands

- To list all tracked file types:
  ```sh
  git lfs ls-files
  ```

- To untrack a file type:
  ```sh
  git lfs untrack "*.bin"
  ```

### Notes

- Replace `path/to/your/largefile.bin` with the actual path to your binary file.
- Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
- Ensure that Git LFS is installed on any machine that clones the repository to handle the large files correctly.
